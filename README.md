# Repo to reproduce and debug cloud functions module loading issue

Repository to debug issue with module loading of Google Cloud Functions

## Problem Summary

For some reason, Google Cloud Functions doesn't seem to be able to load the @google.cloud/* modlues in node.js functions under some circumstances.

This repository is a minimal scaffold to illustrate the issue and how to fix it.
**When deploying the main branch, the initialization of the function will fail, although it works locally and builds deploys correctly using the Google Buildpack locally**.

This repo was created to isolate the issue described on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65538584/google-cloud-functions-sometimes-doesnt-find-google-cloud-dependencies-altho

## Working Versions

There are two ways around the problem and both are illustrated on separate brances in this repo.

```
branch "main" 
- Deploying this version always fails, because the function cannot be initialized, 
due to google cloud not beeing able to locate the package dependency.

branch "working-version" 
- This version fixes the issue by changing the '--source' parameter to the deployment command. 
Bad: --source=./src  
Good: --source=.

branch "index-in-root" 
- This version fixes the issue by hoisting the index.js file out of the src/ folder 
and into the project root AND by changing the '--source' parameter to the deployment 
command to be '--source=.'

```

## Reproducing the issue

Assuming `gcloud` is present and a valid account is setup and initialized.

```
npm run deployHelloWorld
```

The command will trigger an error message along the lines of this

```
> gcloud functions deploy helloWorld --source=./src --entry-point=helloWorld --runtime nodejs12 --memory=256MB --max-instances=3 --trigger-topic=ornitho-bus
